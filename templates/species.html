		<h2>Humans</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>Humans were late onto the galactic travel and they one became a type 1 civilization in 4459 SD, they advanced with the help of the resident Anz and once they became a type one civilization they immediately designed a series of fighters that were supposed to be highly customisable and so they called it the modification series or the mod series for short. Once the series had been developed they started training millions of people to fly a new fighter called the Pii fighter and they mass produced them. A standard Pii fighter comes with 4 light Plasma weapons with limited ammunition 4 plasma engines that used the same plasma as the light plasma weapons and they had massive storage for trading. They were not designed to be fighters but they could do the job. Then a planet borer came into the system and Humans feared the worst so they sent 20000 Pii fighters to destroy them and when that failed they sent the rest of the fighters which numbered around 200000 Pii fighters at the Gagners planet borer. The planet borer was destroyed by Joseph who would later join the Galactic Peace Navy, but only 1000 Pii fighters survived the battle. It crippled the economy but gained respect from Galactic Peace and the Vinitipii. </p>

		<h2>Joefish</h2>
		<img src="/static/joefish_flag.jpg" alt="Weilder System">
		<h3>General Info</h3>
		<p>Joefish are a species that resemble both fish and reptiles this is because they have gills but their skin is similar to lizards. They are about 2 meters tall and with gills on the sides and webbing on the hands and feet.
		The purpose of the gills is to filter out the fine dust of the planet Weilder and the webbing on the feet is to stabilise the feet of the fish. They come in different colour that vary in what they are good at with green science,
		blue peaceful, red warlike, yellow mathematicians, purple diplomats and orange industrial. The most common of the colours is orange and the least common of the colours is purple. Joefish are generally good at math 
		and science but have horrible grammar and they extend their O's. Also, depending on the colour of the fish they are split into tribes according to their skill.</p>
		<h3>System info</h3>
		<p>
		The system they live in is weilder which is the same name as their planet. The system has a class eight star and the closest planet to the star is 2 astronomical units away. There are three planets in the system, Infernoo, Meloont 
		and Weilder. Infernoo is completely inhospitable with the temperature 5000 degrees C and the surface is lava, people on Weilder call it Infernoo as in the ancient language infernoo means 'small heat'. It has two moons which are 
		called the Landeth and Randeth. They are called that because Landeth and Randeth as they mean 'left angle of death' and 'right angle of death' in the ancient language. Meloont on the other hand is a planet that has temperatures 
		close to 400 degrees and has a few volcanos. It is called Meloot as Meloot in the ancient language means 'Melting Pooint'. If a Joefish were to land on the planet they would melt immediately from the heat. Weilder is the only 
		habitable planet in the Weilder system. It was called Weilder as in the ancient language Weilder meant 'home of the people'. Weilder is has 99% desert and 1% volcano with the only place to get water in the caves that were made 
		by an ancient beast in the past that cover the planet. Food is surprisingly easy to find as there are lots of plants on the planet, they are hidden under the sand next to the bedrock and when the Joefish are hungry they dig 
		holes about 5 meters deep and they cook the plants that live there to eat. There are also some animals and they live nearer to the volcanos under the dried up stone from the volcano. When they make the burrows they find stone

		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>
		Originally the Joefish were nomadic tribes that lived in the caves of the planet to avoid the heat and then they travelled at night when the water in the caves ran out. In those days, they worshipped the god of roontah which means ‘god of the caves’ but as time went on the gave up with worshiping roontah and started worshipping the god Jehovah which means ‘god of the universe’. When this happened a group of individuals that called themselves fooueah which in the ancient language means ‘followers of the true god’ left the tribes and went to live around the volcanos in the north. At the same time, some individuals from each tribe sought out a place to find out more about the god Jehovah, these people called themselves foojehovah which means ‘followers of Jehovah’. These individuals moved deep into the earth to live there. Slowly as the population grew they had to travel further to get the water and so they got used to the heat. After a long time, the Joefish tribes found a massive water source and started to settle near it, but as the population grew the need for land grew and so they started to fight. This is how it went for over a thousand years, the purple tribe would make an alliance with the blue tribe and together they would fend of attackers. The red tribe would do most of the attacking therefore they did not defend their land. The green tribe would have technology far better than any other tribe and so they could easily defend themselves. The yellow tribe would use long range weapons and would accurately hit the enemy from massive distances so everyone gave up with trying to kill them. Orange would build massive machines of war and they tried to attack the green tribe to get their tech to upgrade the machines but would always fail. Then the water source dried up and so there was a massive drought and during that time all the tribes joined forces and during that time the advanced significantly at the cost of thousands of lives. After the drought, the Joefish were then hunted by the Gagners and they eventually disabled one of the Gagners ships giving them the technology to advance to a type 1 civilization but even when they advanced they were still hunted by the Gagners and so the Vinitipu gave the Joefish Hyper drive technology causing them to leep frog infront of the Gagners. This happened in the star date of 4120. 30 SDs later the Joefish joined the war in fear of the slavery that would besiege them, but this was not smart as the Joefishes army was the smallest army and the Vinitipu could not defend Weilder and the Vinitipus’ home planet. Thus, the Joefish fleet was destroyed and in 4264 SD Weilder was taken, not without lose from the Gagners as the Mathematicians would use ground missile centers to hit their targets and cripple them. During the time of Gagner control over Weilder Joefish were forced to mine resources to make the Gagners massive battle cruisers but there were a few that hide in the caves, they were of the science tribe and the developed a fighter design and one scientist called Rooman developed a new energy source called the yellow energy crystal but the resources were extremely rare so they could not be used in this war. Then 10 SDs later the Vinitipu defeated the Gagners above Weilder with the help of a few of the fighters that the scientists had developed. Leading these fighters Admiral Rayoon helped the Vinitipu defeat the Gagners over Weilder. Then under the Vinitipii he defeated the Gagners. During the War the Joefish developed the K series fighters and they became Galactic Peace. Then one Human defeated a planet borer and they recruited him as a fighter pilot.

		<h3>Famous Leaders</h3>
		<p>Rooman – Rooman was a scientist from the green clan that and is famous for developing yellow energy crystals that are ten times better than white energy crystals.<br>
Joseph – Joseph was one of the few humans to join the ranks of the Joefish. He was able to join the ranks as he had destroyed the Gagners’ Planet Borer that was targeting Earth and he has been the Joefishes best pilot.<br>
Admiral Rayoon – Admiral Rayoon was the Joefishes’ best Admiral, he led the fighters against the Gagners over Weilder and was recruited by the Vinitipu to defeat the Gagners, which he successfully did.

		<h2>Gagners</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>Gagners are a rare breed of Glowing wolves and are 8 feet tall when they stand on their hind legs and glow bright blue when they’re happy, and bright red when they’re angry. They exhibit strong musical gifts, including singing and saxophone playing, and are found very attractive by human females. Their intelligence is far higher than your average species. Their favorite food is baked Joefish saturated with lemon from the planet Earth, the only problem is that Joefish are a sentient species with good defenses so the cost for them is 21000 gagnets (their currency). They hunt various types and freeze them when transporting them. Since Joefish are extremely rare they are only eaten once or twice a life time and they are usually eaten at the Gagner’s coming of age ceremony. This is called Gagagabum and is held when the Gagners are 13.5 years old, and the average Gagner live approx. 123.4 years.</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Gagner became a type 1 civilization in the Star Date of 3983 and because of the Gagner would not agree to laws that the Vinitipu made the Vinitipu immediately disliked the Gagner and the Gagner disliked the Vinitipu. A 5 SDs later the Gagner developed the Wolv series which design was inspired by the explorer class. One of the fighters, the "Archerious," is universally acknowledged as the fastest, most powerful civilian craft available today, and costs 22,000 gagnets (their currency) when new. Then they discovered the Joefish and started hunting Joefish as they had developed a taste for. Then the Gagners discovered Anz, the Gagners tried eating one but died in the process so instead they started to enslave them at the star date of 4245. 
The Vinitipii then declared war with the Gagners and the Gagners had the Vicious Vinitipu join them and the Vicious Vinitipu were surprised when they discovered that the Gagners had a massive fleet and so they made a deal with the Gagners that if they gave the Vicious Vinitipu Sinatron then they would give the Gagners intel. The Gagner leader at the time was greedy and said no to the Vicious Vinitipu and the Gagners quickly killed the Vicious Vinitipu. The Vinitipii then half their fleet, which was 10 J-3 class cruisers, 10 J-1 class cruisers and 50 S-3 class Starships, to attack the Gagners they were quickly destroyed by the Gagners massive fleet that they had hidden on the other side of the galaxy. The Gagner fleet was 1 J-9, 2 J-7, 4 J-6, 8 J-3, 1 J-2 and 300 S-9s. Alarmed the Vinitipii started building J-9, J-7 and J-5 cruisers but the Gagners destroyed the military production facilities. Having revealed this fleet, the Joefish decided to join the war in 4250SD. 
 Weilder was then taken in 4262 after a long battle over Weilder, the Joefish forces consisted of a few fighters and the Gagner fleet was massive, Weilder was taken back 10 SDs later by the Vinitipu ground force which was larger than the Gagners force, but the Gagners had already taken massive amounts of resources causing the Gagner fleet to be massive. The Joefish, now called Galactic Peace, in 4278 SD repelled a force of Gagner ships that were ten times the strength of the Joefish force, this caused the Gagners to make a fatal move, they focused all their energy into hunting the Joefish force instead of destroying the Vinitipiis’ production line, they managed to succeed. Five years later the Gagners destroyed the Anz planet with a planet borer. Then in 4315 SD Admiral Rayoon, that commanded the Anz, Galactic Peace and Vinitipii fleets, ambushed the Gagners in the System of the primitives Humans and they crippled the Gagners fleet. Then 1 SD later Admiral Rayoon took over Gag1 from the Gagners and they started a ground attack force that was led by Commander Mek, an Anz general. The planet of Gagnese was then taken over 2 SDs later. Thus, the war was ended in 4318 SD.
Seeing the Vinitipii make more fighters the Gagners thought that they were going to destroy them and so in fear they threatened the Vinitipii not to make more fighters or the planet Earth would be destroyed. The Vinitipii, no thinking that the Gagners could do so, ignored them and so the Gagners moved their planet borer into position to destroy earth but the Humans seeing this sent all their Pii fighters to take down this ship but the Gagners were too technologically advanced to be stopped by an attack of 20,000 Pii fighters. The reason Humans had a force this large is because they were civilian ships that were designed to be used for anything and in times of need they could be used as fighters. Then they send one last attempt at destroying the planet borer by sending 200,000 Pii fighters. The planet borer was destroyed by Joseph and he was recruited into Galactic Peace. Only 1000 Pii fighters survived.

		<div id="anzinfo" class="species">
		<h2>Anz</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>The Anz is a very weird species, they are very hairy, and have super long eyes, they almost look like a dog. Their fur is yellow, but their skin is blue. They are bad at speling, grandma, and maths, but they are very good with computer. The Anz only socializes when forced to, but once forced to will become sociable for the next 2 hours. Anz spend on average 97.8 % of their time on computers, and if disturbed when using a computer will attack verbally. The Anz on average have a real friend to Facebook friend ratio of 16700/1.</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>At the star date of 4242 Anz became a type 1 civilization and it was soon followed by the Gagners enslaving them. Then, in 4292 SD, Anz joined the war with a series they designed called the O series, they had a 200-strong force of S-7 fighter that were designed to be low armour but high speeds. Then 1 SD later they started a ground attack force that was led by Commander Mek, an Anz general. The planet of Gagnese was then taken over 2 SDs later. Thus, the war was ended in 4318 SD. The Anz then moved to Earth to live with the Humans in secret as to protect them from the Gagners and during this time they advanced the Humans tech by adding touch displays, microprocessors, and lithium batteries. In 4459 Humans become a type 1 civilization with the help of the Anz thus causing the Anz to colonies another planet 5 SDs later.</p>

		<div id="vinitipuinfo" class="species">
		<h2>Vinitipu</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>The Vinitipu are the oldest civilisation to walk the Galaxy. Physically they are like Humans and do not appear to be any different. The males traditionally have a long beard and wear a cloak proclaiming their importance. The only difference is that they possess a shared mind so that all knowledge is common knowledge and they can teleport relatively small distances. (2km max) They are very wise because of having a deep understanding of the Universe and strive to have peace in the Universe..</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>At 2944SD the Vinitipu became a type 1 civilization any prior knowledge of the Vinitipu is unknown but it was said that they were the first ones to implement diplomacy. 300 SDs later they developed into a type 2 civilization. Soon after that they discovered other primitive species, a few are Gagners, Humans, Joefish and Anz. At 3550SD The Vinitipu developed a series of fighters and cruisers that would be used for hundreds of years and they became a part of the Explorer series. 228SDs later they harnessed the energy of their star giving them almost unlimited power. Then a new species, the Gagner, became type 1 and would not agree to laws that the Vinitipu made the Vinitipu immediately disliked the Gagner and the Gagner disliked the Vinitipu. The Vinitipu then noticed that Joefish were being hunted by the Gagners and so the Vinitipu gave the Joefish the hyperdrive causing the Joefish to leap frog in front of the Gagners in tech and economy.
The Vinitipu were disturbed by what the Gagners were doing, eating Joefish and enslaving Anz, so they looked at the size of the Gagners fleet to theirs and their tech levels then they argued that the for ages whether to go to war and during this time another faction was made called the Vicious Vinitipii and they left. The Vinitipii then tried to use diplomacy but it did not work so they reluctantly declared war in 4248. When the war started the Vicious Vinitipu moved to a planet near the Gagners and offered to give the Gagners intel in return for Sinatron, the Gagners said no and then killed most of the vicious Vinitipii. The Vinitipii expected the war to end quickly as they thought that their military might was more powerful so the sent half their fleet which was 10 J-3 class cruisers, 10 J-1 class cruisers and 50 S-3 class Starships they were quickly destroyed by the Gagners massive fleet that they had hidden on the other side of the galaxy. The Gagner fleet was 1 J-9, 2 J-7, 4 J-6, 8 J-3, 1 J-2 and 300 S-9s. Alarmed the Vinitipii started building J-9, J-7 and J-5 cruisers but the Gagners destroyed the military production facilities. Having revealed this fleet, the Joefish decided to join the war in 4250SD knowing that if the Gagners won the Joefish would be farmed and put into slavery by the Gagners. This was a bad idea as the Joefish only had 2 J-3 class cruisers and 20 J-2 class cruisers which are not designed for war but instead as a defence. Thus, the Vinitipii were losing the war and there was nothing they could do about it.
 Weilder was then taken in 4262 after a long battle over Weilder, the Joefish forces consisted of a few fighters and the Gagner fleet was massive, Weilder was taken back 10 SDs later by the Vinitipu ground force which was larger than the Gagners force, but the Gagners had already taken massive amounts of resources causing the Gagner fleet to be massive. Soon after this the Joefish developed the K series which had fighters superior to the Gagners fighters in every way except speed. With these new fighters, the Joefish, now called Galactic Peace, in 4278 SD repelled a force of Gagner ships that were ten times the strength. With this new force Galactic Peace protected the Vinitipii long enough for them to make a J-9 class cruiser to protect the new ship yards. Then, in 4292 SD, Anz joined the war with a series they designed called the O series, they had a 200-strong force of S-7 fighter that were designed to be low armour but high speeds. Thus, for the first time the war was moving in the Vinitipiis’ favour. Five years later the Gagners destroyed the Anz planet with a planet borer, when this happened the Vinitipii decided that they would use teleportation to destroy the enemy. So, they made a J-10 class cruiser and put on it a teleporter to teleport bombs into the enemies’ ships. Then in 4315 SD Admiral Rayoon, that commanded the Anz, Galactic Peace and Vinitipii fleets, ambushed the Gagners in the System of the primitives Humans and they crippled the Gagners fleet. Then 1 SD later Admiral Rayoon took over Gag1 from the Gagners and they started a ground attack force that was led by Commander Mek, an Anz general. The planet of Gagnese was then taken over 2 SDs later. Thus, the war was ended in 4318 SD.
2 SDs later the Vinitipii started enforcing Galactic Law so that another war like this would never happen. Seeing that Humans were mass producing Pii fighters the Vinitipii got nervious and started to make more fighters. Seeing the Vinitipii make more fighters the Gagners thought that they were going to destroy them and so in fear they threatened the Vinitipii not to make more fighters or the planet Earth would be destroyed. The Vinitipii, no thinking that the Gagners could do so, ignored them and so the Gagners moved their planet borer into position to destroy earth but the Humans seeing this sent all their Pii fighters to take down this ship but the Gagners were too technologically advanced to be stopped by an attack of 20,000 Pii fighters. The reason Humans had a force this large is because they were civilian ships that were designed to be used for anything and in times of need they could be used as fighters. Then they send one last attempt at destroying the planet borer by sending 200,000 Pii fighters. The planet borer was destroyed by Joseph.

		<h3>Legend</h3>
		<p>There are legends of the Vinitipu having more technology than they speak of. There is evidence of intergalactic teleportation, limitless energy creation and potentially time travel. Some say that the Vinitipu are continuously creating new technology but since the Universe is not yet ready for the power of these devices their existence remains a mystery. However, these claims are not reliable and not been proved.</p>

		History of the Galactic Builder Universe

The Universe began at the star Date of 0 SD which is the intergalactic unit of time. The unit is the time taken for the planet of the Vinitipu to orbit the star Sinatron and 1SD is equal to 1.6 years 584 earth days. The universe was created by an all-powerful being that the Joefish call Jehovah which in the Joefish ancient language means ‘God of the Universe’. Then at 2944SD the Vinitipu became a type 1 civilization and 300 SDs later they developed into a type 2 civilization. Soon after that they discovered other primitive species, a few are Gagners, Humans, Joefish and Anz. At 3550SD The Vinitipu developed a series of fighters and cruisers that would be used for hundreds of years and they became a part of the Explorer series. 228SDs later they harnessed the energy of their star giving them almost unlimited power.
 The Vinitipu have been the only civilization that is higher than type 1 but now the Gagner became a type 1 civilization in the Star Date of 3983 and because of the Gagner would not agree to laws that the Vinitipu made the Vinitipu immediately disliked the Gagner and the Gagner disliked the Vinitipu. A 5 SDs later the Gagner developed the Wolv series and started hunting Joefish as they had developed a taste for them but the Joefish destroyed one of the Gagners ships in the and reverse engineered the design putting them to Type 1 at the Star Date of 4118. But even after becoming type 1 the Joefish were still being hunted by the Gagners and so the Vinitipu gave the Joefish the hyperdrive causing the Joefish to leap frog in front of the Gagners in tech and economy. Then at the star date of 4242 Anz became a type 1 civilization. Seeing this new species, the Gagners tried eating one but died in the process so instead they started to enslave them at the star date of 4245. 
The Vinitipu were disturbed by what the Gagners were doing so they looked at the size of the Gagners fleet to theirs and their tech levels and attempted to use diplomacy to stop the Gagners. When that did not work they reluctantly decided to declare war in the star date of 4248. In doing this they split into two factions, the Vinitipii and the Vicious Vinitipu, the Vicious Vinitipu moved to a planet near the Gagners and offer to help the Gagners, but the Gagners killed most of the Vicious Vinitipii. The Vinitipii expected the war to end quickly as they thought that their military might was more powerful so the sent half their fleet which was 10 J-3 class cruisers, 10 J-1 class cruisers and 50 S-3 class Starships they were quickly destroyed by the Gagners massive fleet that they had hidden on the other side of the galaxy.

In 4459 Humans become a type 1 civilization with the help of the Anz thus causing the Anz to colonies another planet 5 SDs later. Very soon after the Humans developed the MOD series and started mass producing Pii fighters. Seeing this the Vinitipii got nervious and started to make more fighters.
