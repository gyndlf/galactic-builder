		<h2>Humans</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>humans have just reached the gotten into contact with the other empires in the area and have developed Pii fighters to move about. Pii fighters are fighters designed to be modified and so they can be the best fighters out there, the only problem is that humans do not have access to the joefish technology. Humans are the balanced species and are ready to come to any species aid but most of the other species do not like humans as the have a number of things that other empires do not allow like alchol. </p>

		<h2>Joefish</h2>
		<img src="/static/joefish_flag.jpg" alt="Weilder System">
		<h3>General Info</h3>
		<p>Joefish are a species that resemble both fish and reptiles this is because they have gills but their skin is similar to lizards. They are about 2 meters tall and with gills on the sides and webbing on the hands and feet.
		The purpose of the gills is to filter out the fine dust of the planet Weilder and the webbing on the feet is to stabilise the feet of the fish. They come in different colour that vary in what they are good at with green science,
		blue peaceful, red warlike, yellow mathematicians, purple diplomats and orange industrial. The most common of the colours is orange and the least common of the colours is purple. Joefish are generally good at math 
		and science but have horrible grammar and they extend their O's. Also, depending on the colour of the fish they are split into tribes according to their skill.</p>
		<h3>System info</h3>
		<p>
		The system they live in is weilder which is the same name as their planet. The system has a class eight star and the closest planet to the star is 2 astronomical units away. There are three planets in the system, Infernoo, Meloont 
		and Weilder. Infernoo is completely inhospitable with the temperature 5000 degrees C and the surface is lava, people on Weilder call it Infernoo as in the ancient language infernoo means 'small heat'. It has two moons which are 
		called the Landeth and Randeth. They are called that because Landeth and Randeth as they mean 'left angle of death' and 'right angle of death' in the ancient language. Meloont on the other hand is a planet that has temperatures 
		close to 400 degrees and has a few volcanos. It is called Meloot as Meloot in the ancient language means 'Melting Pooint'. If a Joefish were to land on the planet they would melt immediately from the heat. Weilder is the only 
		habitable planet in the Weilder system. It was called Weilder as in the ancient language Weilder meant 'home of the people'. Weilder is has 99% desert and 1% volcano with the only place to get water in the caves that were made 
		by an ancient beast in the past that cover the planet. Food is surprisingly easy to find as there are lots of plants on the planet, they are hidden under the sand next to the bedrock and when the Joefish are hungry they dig 
		holes about 5 meters deep and they cook the plants that live there to eat. There are also some animals and they live nearer to the volcanos under the dried up stone from the volcano. When they make the burrows they find stone

		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>
		Originally the Joefish were nomadic tribes that lived in the caves of the planet to avoid the heat and then they travelled at night when the water in the caves ran out. In those days they worshipped the god of roontah which means 
		'god of the caves' but as time went on the gave up with worshiping roontah and started worshipping the god Jehovah which means 'god of the universe'. When this happened a group of individuals that called themselves fooueah which 
		in the ancient language means 'followers of the true god' left the tribes and went to live around the volcanos in the north. At the same time, some individuals from each tribe sought out a place to find out more about the god 
		Jehovah, these people called themselves foojehovah which means 'followers of Jehovah'. These individuals moved deep into the earth to live there. Slowly as the population grew they had to travel further to get the water and so 
		they got used to the heat. After a long time, the Joefish tribes found a massive water source and started to settle near it, but as the population grew the need for land grew and so they started to fight. This is how it went for 
		over a thousand years, the purple tribe would make an alliance with the blue tribe and together they would fend of attackers. The red tribe would do most of the attacking therefore they did not defend their land. The green tribe 
		would have technology far better than any other tribe and so they could easily defend themselves. The yellow tribe would use long range weapons and would accurately hit the enemy from massive distances so everyone gave up with 
		trying to kill them. Orange would build massive machines of war and they tried to attack the green tribe to get their tech to upgrade the machines but would always fail. Then the water source dried up and so there was a massive 
		drought and during that time all the tribes joined forces and during that time the advanced significantly at the cost of thousands of lives. Then they advanced to the space age. When they did they developed the K-series fighters that are the best combat fighters and the crusiers are the best support crusiers.

		<h3>Famous Leaders</h3>
		<p>Rooman – Rooman was a scientist from the green clan that and is famous for developing yellow energy crystals that are ten times better than white energy crystals.
Joseph – Joseph was one of the few humans to join the ranks of the Joefish. He was able to join the ranks as he had destroyed the Gagners’ Planet Borer that was targeting Earth and he has been the Joefishes best pilot.

		<div id="gagnersinfo" class="species">
		<h2>Gagners</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>
		Gagners are a rare breed of glowing wolf. They are 8 feet tall when standing on their hind legs, and glow bright blue when they're happy, and bright red when they're angry. They exhibit strong musical gifts, including singing and saxophone playing, and are found very attractive by human females. They are a highly intelligent race, and the fighter spacecraft they produce, the "Archerious," is universally acknowleged as the fastest, most powerful production craft avaliable today, and costs 22,000 gagnets (their currency) when new. Gagners inhabit the planet Gagnese, which orbits their home star Gag1. A Gagner's favorite food is a baked Joefish saturated in lemon juice, but beacuse their planet is 11 hyperlane jumps away from Weilder the journey is expensive and also highly dangerous as the joefish have good defenses. The hunter/voyagers capture and kill Joefish of various types, and individually freze them in order to keep them fresh for the trip back. A frozen Joefish costs 21,000 gagnets on the planet Gagnese, so most Gagners will only eat one once or twice in a lifetime, usually on special occasions such as the Gagagabum, a Gagner's coming of age ceremony. Gagagabums are held when a Gagner is 13.5 years old, and the average Gagner lives approx. 123.4 years.

		<div id="anzinfo" class="species">
		<h2>Anz</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>The Anz is a very weird species, they are very hairy, and have super long eyes, they almost look like a dog. Their fur is yellow, but their skin is blue. They are bad at speling, grandma, and maths. But they are very good with computer, they are the reason humans have touch displays, microprocessors, and lithium battery's. The Anz only socializes when forced to, but once forced to will become sociable for the next 2 hours. Anz spend on average 97.8 % of their time on computers, and if disturbed when using a computer will attack verbally. The Anz on average have a real friend to Facebook friend ratio of 16700/1.</p>

		<div id="vinitipuinfo" class="species">
		<h2>Vinitipu</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>The Vinitipu are the oldest civilisation to walk the Galaxy. Physically they are similar to Humans and do not apear to be any different. The males traditionally have a long beard and wear a cloak proclaiming their importance. The only difference is that they possess a shared mind so that all knowledge is common knowledge and they can teleport relactivly small distances. (2km max) They are very wise because of having a deep understanding of the Universe and strive to have peace in the Universe.</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Given their shared brain they devolped the first Diplomacy in existance. Believing themselves above war they never fought one another, instead they worked together towards a common goal.  From Sinatron they soon achieved space age technology at Star Date 2944. (1000 Earth Years before anyone else) and quickly conilised their Galaxy. After succussfully becoming a Type 2 civilisation 300 earth years later, the Vinitipu found other species of life. They discovered primitive versions of Anz, Humans and Gagnar making their first steps on their relative planets and the Vinitipu coaxed them along. Soon the Vinitipu became Type 3 civilisation and harnessed all the energy from their host star. They stedily increased their IQ and devolped Hyper Drive. However, upon discovering the intelligent Joefish being eaten by the Gagnar, they gave their Hyper Drive technology to the Joefish alowing them to leap frog the Gagnar in terms of intelligence and economy. The Vinitipu set up the central hub for the universe at the planet Nintex in Sinatron and began to enforce Intergalactic Laws across the universe in Star Date 4333. They are widely regared as the rulers of the Universe, the most wise beings and are the most advanced civilisation.</p>
		<h3>Legend</h3>
		<p>There are ledgends of the Vinitipu having more technology than they speak of. There is evidence of intergalactic teleportation, limitless energy creation and potentially time travel. Some say that the Vinitipu are contiously creating new technology but since the Universe is not yet ready for the power of these devices their existance remains a mystery. However, these claims are not reliable and not been proved.</p>

		History of the Galactic Builder Universe

The Universe began at the star Date of 0 SD which is the intergalactic unit of time. The unit is the time taken for the planet of the Vinitipu to orbit the star Sinatron and 1SD is equal to 1.6 years 584 earth days. The universe was created by an all-powerful being that the Joefish call Jehovah which in the Joefish ancient language means ‘God of the Universe’. Then at 2944SD the Vinitipu became a type 1 civilization and 300 SDs later they developed into a type 2 civilization. Soon after that they discovered other primitive species, a few are Gagners, Humans, Joefish and Anz. At 3550SD The Vinitipu developed a series of fighters and cruisers that would be used for hundreds of years and they became a part of the Explorer series. 228SDs later they harnessed the energy of their star giving them almost unlimited power.

 The Vinitipu have been the only civilization that is higher than type 1 but now the Gagner became a type 1 civilization in the Star Date of 3983 and because of the Gagner would not agree to laws that the Vinitipu made the Vinitipu immediately disliked the Gagner and the Gagner disliked the Vinitipu. A 5 SDs later the Gagner developed the Wolv series and started hunting Joefish as they had developed a taste for them but the Joefish destroyed one of the Gagners ships in the and reverse engineered the design putting them to Type 1 at the Star Date of 4118. But even after becoming type 1 the Joefish were still being hunted by the Gagners and so the Vinitipu gave the Joefish the hyperdrive causing the Joefish to leap frog in front of the Gagners in tech and economy. Then at the star date of 4242 Anz became a type 1 civilization. Seeing this new species, the Gagners tried eating one but died in the process so instead they started to enslave them at the star date of 4245. 

The Vinitipu were disturbed by what the Gagners were doing so they looked at the size of the Gagners fleet to theirs and their tech levels and decided to declare war, in doing this they split into two factions, the Vinitipii and the Vicious Vinitipu, the Vicious Vinitipu moved to a planet near the Gagners and helped the Gagners while the Vinitupii attacked the Gagners. Both factions knew that in this war advanced tech should not be used as if one side gets it the galaxy will enter chaos. The Vinitipii expected the war to end quickly as they thought that their military might was more powerful so the sent half their fleet which was 10 J-3 class cruisers, 10 J-1 class cruisers and 50 S-3 class Starships they were quickly destroyed by the Gagners massive fleet that they had hidden on the other side of the galaxy. The Gagner fleet was 1 J-9, 2 J-7, 4 J-6, 8 J-3, 1 J-2 and 300 S-9s. Alarmed the Vinitipii started building J-9, J-7 and J-5 cruisers but the Gagners destroyed the military production facilities. Having Revealed this for the Joefish desided to join the war in 4250SD knowing that if the Gagners won the Joefish would be farmed and put into slavery by the Gagners. This was a bad idea as the Joefish only had 2 J-3 class cruisers and 20 J-2 class cruisers which are not designed for war but instead as a defence. Thus, the Vinitipii were losing the war and there was nothing they could do about it.

 Weilder was then taken in 4262 after a long battle over Weilder, the Joefish forces consisted of a few fighters and the Gagner fleet was massive, Weilder was taken back 10 SDs later by the Vinitipu ground force which was larger than the Gagners force, but the Gagners had already taken massive amounts of resources causing the Gagner fleet to be massive. Soon after this the Joefish developed the K series which had fighters superior to the Gagners fighters in every way except speed. With these new fighters, the Joefish, now called Galactic Peace, in 4278 SD repelled a force of Gagner ships that were ten times the strength. With this new force Galactic Peace protected the Vinitipii long enough for them to make a J-9 class cruiser to protect the new ship yards. Then, in 4292 SD, Anz joined the war with a series they designed called the O series, they had a 200-strong force of S-7 fighter that were designed to be low armour but high speeds. Thus, for the first time the war was moving in the Vinitipiis’ favour. Five years later the Gagners destroyed the Anz planet with a planet borer, when this happened the Vinitipii decided that they would use teleportation to destroy the enemy. So, they made a J-10 class cruiser and put on it a teleporter to teleport bombs into the enemies’ ships. Then in 4315 SD Admiral Rayoon, that commanded the Anz, Galactic Peace and Vinitipii fleets, ambushed the Gagners in the System of the primitives Humans and they crippled the Gagners fleet. Then 1 SD later Admiral Rayoon took over Gag1 from the Gagners and they started a ground attack force that was led by Commander Mek, an Anz general. The planet of Gagnese was then taken over 2 SDs later. Thus, the war was ended in 4318 SD.

2 SDs later the Vinitipii started enforcing Galactic Law so that another war like this would never happen and the Anz moved to Earth to live with the Humans in secret as to protect them from the Gagners. In 4459 Humans become a type 1 civilization with the help of the Anz thus causing the Anz to colonies another planet 5 SDs later. Very soon after the Humans developed the MOD series and started mass producing Pii fighters. Seeing this the Vinitipii got nervious and started to make more fighters. Seeing the Vinitipii make more fighters the Gagners thought that they were going to destroy them and so in fear they threatened the Vinitipii not to make more fighters or the planet Earth would be destroyed. The Vinitipii, no thinking that the Gagners could do so, ignored them and so the Gagners moved their planet borer into position to destroy earth but the Humans seeing this sent all their Pii fighters to take down this ship but the Gagners were too technologically advanced to be stopped by an attack of 20,000 Pii fighters. The reason Humans had a force this large is because they were civilian ships that were designed to be used for anything and in times of need they could be used as fighters. Then they send one last attempt at destroying the planet borer by sending 200,000 Pii fighters. The planet borer was destroyed by Joseph and he was recruited into Galactic Peace. Only 1000 Pii fighters survived.
