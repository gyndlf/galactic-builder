<h3>History</h3>
<p>The Vexxors are an ancient race. Robotics is a key part of their history and present with many jobs automated. This species seeks to learn much about the universe and its secrets. The species have rich income with a history of trading. The species tended to use small armies or large droid armies in the few wars between nations. The Vexxors tend to not be as strong as other creatures due to the use of robots for heavy and physically challenging work tending to spend more time in a lab or running businesses. This has led to them being easily overpowered by the Haxxors an alien race that enslaved them 5000 years ago. After being enslaved for 20 years the Vexxors using their superior intelligence built a droid army up to fight the Haxxors using parts stolen from here and there. The Haxxors were either captured or fled to their heavily polluted home planet Chani in the same star system as Norse Koera.</p>
