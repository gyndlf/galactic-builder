<h2>Vinitipu</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>The Vinitipu are the oldest civilisation to walk the Galaxy. Physically they are similar to Humans and do not apear to be any different. The males traditionally have a long beard and wear a cloak proclaiming their importance. The only difference is that they possess a shared mind so that all knowledge is common knowledge and they can teleport relactivly small distances. (2km max) They are very wise because of having a deep understanding of the Universe and strive to have peace in the Universe.</p>
		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Given their shared brain they devolped the first Diplomacy in existance. Believing themselves above war they never fought one another, instead they worked together towards a common goal.  From Sinatron they soon achieved space age technology at Star Date 2944. (1000 Earth Years before anyone else) and quickly conilised their Galaxy. After succussfully becoming a Type 2 civilisation 300 earth years later, the Vinitipu found other species of life. They discovered primitive versions of Anz, Humans and Gagnar making their first steps on their relative planets and the Vinitipu coaxed them along. Soon the Vinitipu became Type 3 civilisation and harnessed all the energy from their host star. They stedily increased their IQ and devolped Hyper Drive. However, upon discovering the intelligent Joefish being eaten by the Gagnar, they gave their Hyper Drive technology to the Joefish alowing them to leap frog the Gagnar in terms of intelligence and economy. The Vinitipu set up the central hub for the universe at the planet Nintex in Sinatron and began to enforce Intergalactic Laws across the universe in Star Date 4333. They are widely regared as the rulers of the Universe, the most wise beings and are the most advanced civilisation.</p>
		<h3>Legend</h3>
		<p>There are ledgends of the Vinitipu having more technology than they speak of. There is evidence of intergalactic teleportation, limitless energy creation and potentially time travel. Some say that the Vinitipu are contiously creating new technology but since the Universe is not yet ready for the power of these devices their existance remains a mystery. However, these claims are not reliable and not been proved.</p>
