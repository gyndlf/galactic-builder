<h2>Humans</h2>
		<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>Humans were late onto the galactic travel and they one became a type 1 civilization in 4459 SD, they advanced with the help of the resident Anz and once they became a type one civilization they immediately designed a series of fighters that were supposed to be highly customisable and so they called it the modification series or the mod series for short. Once the series had been developed they started training millions of people to fly a new fighter called the Pii fighter and they mass produced them. A standard Pii fighter comes with 4 light Plasma weapons with limited ammunition 4 plasma engines that used the same plasma as the light plasma weapons and they had massive storage for trading. They were not designed to be fighters but they could do the job. Then a planet borer came into the system and Humans feared the worst so they sent 20000 Pii fighters to destroy them and when that failed they sent the rest of the fighters which numbered around 200000 Pii fighters at the Gagners planet borer. The planet borer was destroyed by Joseph who would later join the Galactic Peace Navy, but only 1000 Pii fighters survived the battle. It crippled the economy but gained respect from Galactic Peace, the Slang and the Vinitipii. Then in 4352 they signed the FNM.</p>
