		<h3>General Info</h3>
		<p>Joefish are a species that resemble both fish and reptiles this is because they have gills but their skin is similar to lizards. They are about 2 meters tall and with gills on the sides and webbing on the hands and feet.
		The purpose of the gills is to filter out the fine dust of the planet Weilder and the webbing on the feet is to stabilise the feet of the fish. They come in different colour that vary in what they are good at with green science,
		blue peaceful, red warlike, yellow mathematicians, purple diplomats and orange industrial. The most common of the colours is orange and the least common of the colours is purple. Joefish are generally good at math 
		and science but have horrible grammar and they extend their O's. Also, depending on the colour of the fish they are split into tribes according to their skill.</p>
		<h3>System info</h3>
		<p>
		The system they live in is weilder which is the same name as their planet. The system has a class eight star and the closest planet to the star is 2 astronomical units away. There are three planets in the system, Infernoo, Meloont 
		and Weilder. Infernoo is completely inhospitable with the temperature 5000 degrees C and the surface is lava, people on Weilder call it Infernoo as in the ancient language infernoo means 'small heat'. It has two moons which are 
		called the Landeth and Randeth. They are called that because Landeth and Randeth as they mean 'left angle of death' and 'right angle of death' in the ancient language. Meloont on the other hand is a planet that has temperatures 
		close to 400 degrees and has a few volcanos. It is called Meloot as Meloot in the ancient language means 'Melting Pooint'. If a Joefish were to land on the planet they would melt immediately from the heat. Weilder is the only 
		habitable planet in the Weilder system. It was called Weilder as in the ancient language Weilder meant 'home of the people'. Weilder is has 99% desert and 1% volcano with the only place to get water in the caves that were made 
		by an ancient beast in the past that cover the planet. Food is surprisingly easy to find as there are lots of plants on the planet, they are hidden under the sand next to the bedrock and when the Joefish are hungry they dig 
		holes about 5 meters deep and they cook the plants that live there to eat. There are also some animals and they live nearer to the volcanos under the dried up stone from the volcano. When they make the burrows they find stone

		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>
		Originally the Joefish were nomadic tribes that lived in the caves of the planet to avoid the heat and then they travelled at night when the water in the caves ran out. In those days they worshipped the god of roontah which means 
		'god of the caves' but as time went on the gave up with worshiping roontah and started worshipping the god Jehovah which means 'god of the universe'. When this happened a group of individuals that called themselves fooueah which 
		in the ancient language means 'followers of the true god' left the tribes and went to live around the volcanos in the north. At the same time, some individuals from each tribe sought out a place to find out more about the god 
		Jehovah, these people called themselves foojehovah which means 'followers of Jehovah'. These individuals moved deep into the earth to live there. Slowly as the population grew they had to travel further to get the water and so 
		they got used to the heat. After a long time, the Joefish tribes found a massive water source and started to settle near it, but as the population grew the need for land grew and so they started to fight. This is how it went for 
		over a thousand years, the purple tribe would make an alliance with the blue tribe and together they would fend of attackers. The red tribe would do most of the attacking therefore they did not defend their land. The green tribe 
		would have technology far better than any other tribe and so they could easily defend themselves. The yellow tribe would use long range weapons and would accurately hit the enemy from massive distances so everyone gave up with 
		trying to kill them. Orange would build massive machines of war and they tried to attack the green tribe to get their tech to upgrade the machines but would always fail. Then the water source dried up and so there was a massive 
		drought and during that time all the tribes joined forces and during that time the advanced significantly at the cost of thousands of lives. Then they advanced to the space age. When they did they developed the K-series fighters that are the best combat fighters and the crusiers are the best support crusiers.
