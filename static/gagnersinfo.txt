<h2>Gagners</h2>
<h3>General info</h3>
		<p>
		Gagners are a rare breed of glowing wolf. They are 8 feet tall when standing on their hind legs, and glow bright blue when they're happy, and bright red when they're angry. They exhibit strong musical gifts, including singing and saxophone playing, and are found very attractive by human females. They are a highly intelligent race, and the fighter spacecraft they produce, the "Archerious," is universally acknowleged as the fastest, most powerful production craft avaliable today, and costs 22,000 gagnets (their currency) when new. Gagners inhabit the planet Gagnese, which orbits their home star Gag1. A Gagner's favorite food is a baked Joefish saturated in lemon juice, but beacuse their planet is 11 hyperlane jumps away from Weilder the journey is expensive and also highly dangerous as the joefish have good defenses. The hunter/voyagers capture and kill Joefish of various types, and individually freze them in order to keep them fresh for the trip back. A frozen Joefish costs 21,000 gagnets on the planet Gagnese, so most Gagners will only eat one once or twice in a lifetime, usually on special occasions such as the Gagagabum, a Gagner's coming of age ceremony. Gagagabums are held when a Gagner is 13.5 years old, and the average Gagner lives approx. 123.4 years.
