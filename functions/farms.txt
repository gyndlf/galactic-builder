Food needed = Population * 5

Food sent = Dynamic Variable

Selling Food Value = (Food needed - Food sent) * 3

Farm Value = Selling food value / 10 {But if less than Total Produced / 10 it is Total Produced * 2}

Farm Cost = Farm Value * 3000

Level Cost = Farm Cost * 500

Farm Level = Upgradable Value

Number Of farms = Upgradable Value

Amount produced = Farm Level * Number of Farms

Total Produced = Dynamic Variable

Income = Amount produced * Selling Food value
