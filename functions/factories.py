#Has all factory functions

#From the spreadsheet:
#Income = Product cost * amount produced
#Product cost = Constant value
#Amount produced = 1.5^(Factory Level)*5
#Factory Level = Upgradable Value
#Profit = (Income) - (Material Cost * Amount Produced) - (Amount of workers * Worker Salary) {If less than $0, profit is $0}
#Factory Upgrade Cost = Money Made * 3
#Material Cost = Each resource * Resource cost
#Amount of workers = Factory level * 10 (Change to 30?)
#Salary = Constant Value
