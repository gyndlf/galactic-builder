From the spreadsheet:
Income = Product cost * amount produced
Product cost = Constant value
Amount produced = 1.5^(Factory Level)*5
Factory Level = Upgradable Value
Profit = (Income) - (Material Cost * Amount Produced) - (Amount of workers * Worker Salary) {If less than $0, profit is $0}
Factory Upgrade Cost = Money Made * 3
Material Cost = Each resource * Resource cost
Amount of workers = Factory level * 10 (Change to 30?)
Salary = Constant Value

New Values

Need to display:
Income
Profit (Net Income)
Produced
Level
Upgrade Cost
Material Cost
Amount of workers ???
Salary ???

New Formulas:
Income = Product cost * amount produced
Amount produced = 1.5^(Factory Level)*5
Profit = Income - (Material Cost * Amount Produced) {If less than $0, profit is $0}
Factory Upgrade Cost = Profit * 3
Material Cost = Each resource * Resource cost
