This is a guide on how to use create a button in html
By James

Use this code:

<form action="/user/{{ name }}/button" method="post">
    <p>This is example text next to the button</p><input type="submit" name="NAME" value="DISPLAYED">
    </form>

In the form tag you can put text if you have to but try not as it is easier to debug.
Any button tag should work, but no testing has been done yet.

The NAME (Look above) is not displayed but needed by the code. DISPLAYED is the displayed value and can be anything.
As soon as you make a button put it in buttons.txt so that James can add it to the python code.
