Hello Previous Players of the Lego Game

You are invited to the New Game of Galactic Builder!
This game will be on a website instead of a spreadsheet expanding our opportunities and making harder to cheat.
This gives us more control and we can add many more features!

If you want to be apart of this game then send me a reply with:
1. Your user name (Preferably your actual name. You cannot change it!)
2. Password (Keep it hidden, duh!)
3. Species info (Is not required and without it you will be humans)

Us developers would love to see you play the game

Cheers
Galactic Builder's Team
