Three types of varibles:
    - Personal Varibles
        In these everyone has their own copy of the same varible name but have different values.
        Things like money, number of farms and farm level at personal varibles. They are saved
        at the end after you press a button

    - Dynamic Varibles
        These are varibles that are constantly changing and have to be recalculated almost
        everytime the page is loaded. Anything in the 'Functions' folder is a 'recipie' for
        dynamic varibles. These are not saved as they just get read from.

    - Dynamic Varible types
        The special file 'total.py' finds the total varibles. Things like total food produced

    - Constant Varibles
        These are varibles that never change. They are stored in the values.p file (Why not use a python file?)
        Things like mine value and populations are in here.
